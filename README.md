This repository includes the third project under Data Scientist with Python career track from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python), which entails finding the true Scala experts by exploring its development history in Git and GitHub.

*Note: The project(s) are taken after finishing the courses—Data Manipulation with pandas and Joining Data with pandas—using Python.*

## :computer: Project Description (from DataCamp)
> Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

> The dataset includes the project history of [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.
